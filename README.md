The purpose of this project was to create a quiz from scratch using java css and html. I really struggled with the css but I grasped the javascript and html very easily. I used a random number to determine which question popped up but due to the small amount of questions, some might repeat. The highscore page works as intended but just looks less desirable due to poor css.
